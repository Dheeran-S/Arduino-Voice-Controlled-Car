Voice-Controlled Arduino Car
Intelligent Voice Recognition System
Project Overview

This project combines machine learning and embedded systems to build a voice-controlled Arduino car that responds to real-time spoken commands. Using an audio classification model, the system recognizes voice inputs and converts them into precise movements of a custom-built robotic vehicle.

The project demonstrates how modern ML frameworks like TensorFlow can be integrated with low-level hardware to enable intelligent, real-world interaction.

Technical Implementation

At its core, the system uses TensorFlow for real-time audio processing and command recognition. A trained audio classification model identifies predefined voice commands, which are transmitted to an Arduino microcontroller. The Arduino then controls the car’s motors and sensors through a custom-designed circuit.

The hardware setup integrates:

Motor drivers for smooth movement

Power management for stable operation

Audio input modules for voice capture

The design is modular, allowing easy expansion with additional sensors, commands, or communication modules.
