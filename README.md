Voice-Controlled Arduino Car: Intelligent Voice Recognition System
Project Overview
This innovative project combines cutting-edge machine learning with embedded systems to create a voice-controlled Arduino car that responds to real-time audio commands. The system processes voice input through a sophisticated audio classification model and translates these commands into precise movements of a custom-built Arduino vehicle.

Technical Implementation
At its core, the system utilizes TensorFlow for real-time audio processing and command recognition. The machine learning model is trained to identify specific voice commands, which are then transmitted to an Arduino microcontroller that controls the car's motors and sensors. The project includes a custom-designed circuit that integrates motor drivers, power management, and sensor arrays for responsive and accurate movement.
